resource-provider logs:
```
  @signalk/resources-provider Resources Provider (built-in) starting....... +0ms
  @signalk/resources-provider Applied config: {"standard":{"routes":true,"waypoints":true,"notes":true,"regions":true},"custom":[{"name":"metadata"}],"path":"./resources"} +1ms
  @signalk/resources-provider ** Enabled resource types: ["routes","waypoints","notes","regions","metadata"] +0ms
```
Then a little later:
```
  @signalk/resources-provider /Users/preeve/.signalk/plugin-config-data/resources-provider/resources/metadata - OK.... +0ms
```
So far all looks normal. Then the following message which has nothing
to do with my use of the metadata resource type and seems entirely
spontaneous/erroneous.
```
  @signalk/resources-provider *** apiGetResource:  metadata, {"position":null} +4s
```
And then in response to an app.resourcesApi.setResource call:
```
  No provider for metadata +4ms
```
Which appears to be in direct conflict with what has gone before.

Something is broken in resource-provider?

'Remember debug settings' only works for plugins that require configuration

I have a plugin that doesn't require a configuration file and starts
automatically. I can enable debug for the plugin in the "Server log"
dashboard and enable "Remember debug settings", but this doesn't work.

I guess that this may be related in some way to #999.

Plugin configuration support for autostart plugins seems to be
fundamentally broken, with side effects for plugin debugging and,
I guess, also logging (I haven't checked).
