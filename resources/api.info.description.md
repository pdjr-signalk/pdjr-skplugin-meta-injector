This API exposes all of the functional characteristics of
[pdjr-skplugin-metadata](https://github.com/pdjr-signalk/pdjr-skplugin-metadata).
      
When executing in a Signal K context the plugin services are available
under the root
```https://*server_ip*:*server_port/plugins/metadata/```.

The Signal K documentation uses the terms 'key' and 'path' as synonyms
for the identifier of a data item in the Signal K data store.
This document always uses the term 'key'.
