    [pdjr-skplugin-metadata](https://github.com/pdjr-signalk/pdjr-skplugin-metadata)
    is a plugin for the
    [Signal K node server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server).

    A Signal K server hosting the plugin will present this API under
    the root https://*server_ip*:*server_port*/plugins/metadata.
  
    Metadata resources returned by the following requests are filtered
    to exclude keys de-selected by the 'excludePaths' configuration
    property.
